# Underserved

<b> Mission Statement </b><br/>
Independent developers do not have the resources to do their own market research. We are creating a tool that provides these developers with a platform, to expedite their own market research, based on convenient access to aggregated Steam game data.<br/>
"We’ve got game/tag/metascore data, and we’re giving folks a few options to select tags with the goal of finding underserved niches in the game market."

<b>Target User</b><br/>
The independent game developer, who is looking to gain a strategic edge, by using information that is already available.<br/><br/>
